# Assignment-Management-Software-System-using-Trees-Data-Structure
We have designed a program which takes input of student list and assignment list using Trees and File handling, and each assignment list has a separate tree inside and then insertions are made in assignment list based on insertions in student list and vice versa and also sorting them based on different parameters.
